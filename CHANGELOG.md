## [1.8.0] – 2026-03-19

### Added
- **Paintable surface area** calculated for every profile type — outer perimeter × length × quantity displayed in calculator results, project aggregates, CSV and PDF exports
- **Painting cost estimation** at project level — configurable paint price per kg and coverage rate (m²/kg, default 8) with automatic paint-needed and total-cost rollup
- **Multiple paint coats** — adjustable coat count (1–10) per project; paint needed scales accordingly
- **Perimeter data for all 138 EN standard profile sizes** — IPE, IPN, HEA, HEB, HEM, UPN, UPE, and T-sections now include perimeterMm for accurate surface area calculation
- Painting section in project drawer with editable price/kg, coverage, and coats inputs
- Surface area column in project CSV and PDF exports
- Painting summary stats (total surface area, paint needed, painting cost) in PDF export header

### Changed
- **Desktop:** Resizable split between calculator form and result panel (persisted width; double-click gutter to reset)
- **Desktop:** Optional third column (Saved bookmarks only), persisted; second resizable gutter; keyboard control on both gutters (arrows nudge, Home/End min/max)
- **Workspace (desktop):** Toggle Saved side panel, max result column width preset (320�480px), reset column widths
- **Results:** References block moved under grand total, above full calculation steps
- **Results:** Per-profile cross-section schematic in header (each of the 20 profile types); �This calculation� context (length, qty, EN notes); clipboard + CSV include structured spec lines when present
- Calculator result receipt now shows surface area between weight and cost sections when available
- Result header shows a compact cross-section area, material density, and area formula above the action row
- Clipboard copy format includes surface area line when present
- Clipboard copy includes a geometry line (area, density, formula) after the profile summary
- Project aggregate cards include painting data when surface area is available

## [1.7.0] � 2026-03-17

### Added
- Route-backed mobile app shell with dedicated Calculator, Saved, Projects, and Settings screens
- Localized Saved, Projects, and Settings routes with route metadata in both supported languages
- Edge-swipe navigation between primary mobile tabs

### Changed
- Primary mobile navigation now uses real routes with swipeable tab transitions while desktop keeps the existing sidebar and drawer workflow
- Current calculation state, result bar, and overlays now stay live while moving between mobile tabs
- Settings and Projects now reuse shared content as full mobile screens instead of mobile-only sheets
- Mobile breakpoints are aligned to the app-shell experience across tabs and overlays

### Fixed
- Missing labels in the new mobile app shell for the Saved sidebar entry and result-bar actions
- Swipe-to-action rows now block tab-swipe navigation to avoid gesture conflicts

## [1.6.0] – 2026-03-11

### Added
- Named saves — calculations can now be saved with a custom name and optional notes via a save dialog
- Save dialog: name input + notes textarea shown when clicking Save on any result
- ⋯ action sheet on mobile — single button opens Compare, Save, and Add to Project in one place
- Bookmark icon fills when the current calculation is already saved

### Changed
- Auto-save history removed — replaced with intentional named saves (no more automatic clutter)
- Bottom tab bar: History tab replaced with Saved tab — bookmark icon with count badge
- Saved items redesigned to match project card style — bordered cards with small icon buttons, no timestamp
- Category-colored icons (tubes=blue, plates=amber, structural=green, bars=purple) in saved drawer and project calculations
- Grade badges color-matched to profile category for quick material recognition

### Fixed
- Quick Calc no longer resets price basis, unit price, currency, waste, VAT, and rounding precision when loading a result — user settings are now preserved app-wide

## [1.5.0] – 2026-03-09

### Added

- Keyboard navigation inside the palette (arrow keys, Enter, Escape)
- **Project section enhancements**: cost metrics per project, per-calculation notes, PDF export, project description field
- Sorting and filtering within projects (by weight, cost, date)
- Project duplication shortcut
- Dimension preset management (save, load, delete presets per profile)

### Changed
- Results bar unified across mobile and desktop — receipt-style layout with consistent weight/cost display
- Mobile result overlay redesigned for clarity and touch targets

### Fixed
- Results bar weight and cost display inconsistency between mobile mini-card and desktop panel
